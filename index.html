        <b>Wave Race 64</b> is a 1996 racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64.
        Gameplay involves the player racing on a personal wavecraft on a variety of courses while 
        successfully maneuvering the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can
        compete against each other on a chosen course is also included. The supports the Controller Pak, 
        which allows players to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.

      <p class="second-paragraph-top">
        Originally referred to as "F-Zero on water", the game was intended to feature high-speed boats width
        transforming capabilities, but these were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis as producer Shigeru Miyamoto
        felt that the game would not be differentiated enough from other titles on the systems. Wave Race 64 
        recieved acclaim from critics, who praised the game's satifying controls and dynamic watery environments.
        The game is credited with helping Nintendo effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics
        of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities. It was re-released for the Wii
        and Wii U's virtual Console in 2007 and 2016, respectively, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2022.
        A sequel, Wave Race: Blue Storm, was releaed for the Gamecube in 2001.

            <p class="first-paragraph-gp" style="margin-left: 10px;">Wave race 64 is a racing video game in which <br>the players race on personal water craft
              in <br>different weather conditions and on a variety of <br>courses. The game features three Single-player<br> modes 
              (Championship, Time Trials, and Stunt<br> Mode) as well as a multiplayer mode for <br>competitive play. In the championship mode,
              <br>the player must race opponents through a<br> series of courses and win first place. Up to four<br> levels can be chosen:
              Normal, Hard, Expert,<br> and Reverse, the latter being the Expert track<br> with the track oriented backwards.
              Hard, Expert, <br>and Reverse must be unlocked by completing an<br> earlier difficulty. The difficulty also determines
              the<br> number of courses played: six in Normal, seven in Hard, and eight in Expert/Reverse.
              When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the quantity is not met,
              the player will be disqualified and the game will be over.

        <p class="second-paragraph-gp">
          While racing opponents, the player must successfully manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. 
          There are two types of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys,
           which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the 
           game's HUD will light, allowing the player's watercraft to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can 
           be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to 
           maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's 
           accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys over the course 
           of a race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five 
           seconds will also result in disqualification.
        </p>
  
        <p class="third-paragraph-gp">
          In Time Trials, the player can freely race on a course to perform the best times, which are recorded in the game's data. 
          In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon 
          how many rings the player passes through without missing, as well as the class of stunt that has been performed. 
          The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course.
          Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer
          modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses.
          A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.

        <p>
          Wave Race 64 was developed by Nintendo EAD and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto as one of the first Nintendo 64 games.Development 
          of the game was led by Shinya Takahashi, who had been working with Nintendo since 1989.Takahashi, along with Yoshiaki Koizumi, 
          who worked with Miyamoto on Super Mario 64, are credited for helping the company effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 
          16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities.Since the game's engineers 
          only had experience with the 2D graphics of earlier Nintendo consoles, Takahashi had to guide them through the first stages of development.
          While experimenting with the Nintendo 64's Silicon Graphics technology, one of the programmers created a tech demo that served as an 
          example of the game's wave programming. The tech demo caught the attention of Miyamoto, and soon the team began to figure out a way to
           create "something fun" from it.

            Originally, the game was referred to as "F-Zero on water" and would feature high-speed boats, as shown in footage from the 1995 Nintendo 
            Shoshinkai show.The boats were planned to have transforming capabilities, allowing players to switch from a stable catamaran-style form 
            to a more streamlined canoe-style version.However, the boats were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis at the suggestion of Rare's Tim Stamper.
            Miyamoto explained that "boats looked pretty good at the show, but I didn't think that Wave Race 64 would be unique from similar games on 
            other systems if we used boats. Jet Skis can show many maneuvers that work well in the realistic water of Wave Race 64". The game uses the 
            Nintendo 64's alpha blending feature to make the water simultaneously transparent and reflective.

            Wave Race 64 was promoted with a marketing campaign that cost $4 million. It was first released in Japan in September 1996 on an 8-MB cartridge.
            In the United States, Wave Race 64 was released as the third Nintendo 64 game on November 4, 1996, featuring voice changes and renamed 
            levels. It was the first racing game developed for the Nintendo 64 and the first to use the Nintendo 64's hardware capabilities to "create a 
            believable and engaging water environment unmatched by previous games". In the United Kingdom, the game was released in April 1997, shortly 
            after the launch of the Nintendo 64. Like Super Mario 64, Wave Race 64 was re-issued in Japan in July 1997 as Wave Race 64 Shindō Pak Taiō 
            Version (ウエーブレース64 振動パック対応バージョン, "Wave Race 64: Rumble Pak-Compatible Version"). This version takes advantage of the Nintendo 64 
            Rumble Pak and adds ghost functions to the game's time trial mode, in the form of a dolphin that races against the player and represents the previous
             best time on the course. Some music and sound effects were altered as well.
